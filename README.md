KnownPlainText
==============

These are the client files needed to connect to the KnownPlainText
service. Below is the installation instructions, usage, and a list 
of files included in the repository. If you have any questions please
contact support@knownplaintext.co

Installation
------------

Before you begin you will need to have Python 2.6 or higher installed. 
Python 2.6 is already installed on most modern *nix machines and on 
Mac OS X. If you plan to run the client on Windows you will need to 
install the latest version of Python 2.x, which you can get at 
http://www.python.org/getit/. You will also need to install pip, which 
you can get at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip.

1. Install the Requests library: `pip install requests`
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/KnownPlainText`
3. Place the license.key file into the cloned directory.
4. Confirm the client works properly: `client.py -p test.pwdump`

If you have any trouble running the client please contact support@knownplaintext.co.

Usage
-----
There are two ways to use the client. The first, is to use the -p option and 
provide a file in PWDUMP format. Each line of the file should be in the following 
format:

    `user:id:lm_hash:ntlm_hash:::`

If you provide a PWDUMP file then each found password will be matched up to the 
appropriate username. The username information is not sent to the KnownPlainText 
server.

The second way to use the client is to use the -f option and provide a file that 
contains a list of password hashes in the following format:

    `ntlm_hash:lm_hash`

If you use the -f option, then each found password will be matched up to the 
appropriate ntlm_hash.

### Examples ###
`client.py -p test.pwdump`
`client.py -f test.hashes`
